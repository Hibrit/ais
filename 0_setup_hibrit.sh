#!/bin/bash
# author: hibrit
# purpose: this script will install arch linux by itself

#! even after done with live-iso set a automatic one time script to install the rest of system on first boot
#! on first boot set auto log-in and immidiately after logging in deisable that
#! definitely install both for uefi and legacy than autoselect it
#! lets use python scripts, dialog package (it is not default for arch live-iso)
#! maybe curses can be used with the pre-developed idea of tui in passman project
#! to inform and communucate with user
#! at the end transform this to a package that can be installed to arch linux
#! THIS IS BASICALLY A TUI INSTALLER TO ARCH LINUX ^o^
#! most automatic version of it will set up my own things entirely
#! this can be achieved with a config file and let anybody create their owns
#! so arch linux installations can be shared this way .....
